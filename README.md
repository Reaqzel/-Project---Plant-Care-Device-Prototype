  Project - Plant Care Device Prototype
    General GUI with User Identification and Login
    Requirements are not set other than test user
    To do: (Email, Name, User Number, User Device Number)

    
  Back-End
    General tables are set
    Interactions are set to safe approaches
    To do: (Lower interaction times, more efficient device selection, more interactive values that show in the GUI)

  Sensors and Motors
    General circuit is established
    Motor for irrigation needs to be changed, so irrigation logic is empty
    More precise sensors for light and heat are needed, but logic is working with basic ones
    To do: (Get a better motor and sensors, and use maybe PIC for more control and less calculating power for the computer)
